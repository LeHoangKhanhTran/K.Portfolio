                I'm Khiem Le - a graphic designer & illustrator with 8 years of experience in the creative industry. 
                Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that have strengthened my skills in visual storytelling, 
                branding, and illustration. I’m always eager to learn, explore new techniques, and challenge myself with fresh ideas. 
                My goal is to continue growing as a designer while contributing to the design industry in a sustainable and meaningful 
                way. My passion for design is driven by a desire to create visually engaging work that not only captivates but also communicates 
                a deeper message and leaves a lasting impact.
